# Spirit-Level-Tester   
A Proteus simulation of testing whether a person is acting funny :P
This project is done for partial fulfillment of CS F241 - Microprocessors and Interfacing course taught at BITS Pilani.

For running the simulation successfully:
  1. Proteus needs to be installed. (Mostly on Windows OS)
  2. Project.com file needs to be burnt into the MuP(8086 in this case)
  3. While using keypad, give time for bounceback.
  
**Improvements suggested:** Use 8284 as clock generator instead of the one provided by Proteus. ROM need not be used, as power is generally not a problem during simulations.

### Main Design on Proteus
